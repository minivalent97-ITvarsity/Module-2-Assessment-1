                    <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly hebivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Sahran Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the astern gorillas and the western goillas (both critically endangred), and either fiur or five subspecies.They are he largest living primates.

                    <p>Gorillas natiural habitats cover tropical or subtropica forest in sub-Suharan Africa. Although their range, covers a small percentage of sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the virunga volcanoes, ranging in altitde from 2,200 to 4,30 metre (7,200 to 4,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live  in dense forests and lowlad swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with wersten lowland gorillas living in the Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas livimg in the Democratic Republic of thr Congo near its border with Rwanda</p>
