                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>The common warthog is amedium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 metrs (2 feet 11 inches to 4 feet 1 inches), and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85cm (2 ft in to 2 ft 9and half in) Females at 45 to 75 kg (99 to 165 pound) are typically slightly smaller lighter in weight than males, at 60 to 150kg (130 to 330lb) A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair become razor-sharp by rubbig gainst the upper pair every time mouth is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5cm long and hve a wide elliptical cross section being about 4.5cm deep and 2.5cm wide. A tusk will curve 90degrees or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table as it curves somewhat backwards as its grows. The tusks are not used for digging but are used for combat with other hogs, and in defense against predators- the lower set can infict severe wounds. Common warthog ivory is taken from the constantly growing canine teeth. Th tusks, particularly the upper set, work in much the same way as eephant tusks with all designs scaled down. Tusks are carved predominantly for the tourist trade in east and southern Africa.</p>
