                    <p>Elephants are large animals of th family Elephantide and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the african elphant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephants (Elepha maximus), although some evidence suggested that African bush elephans and African forest elephants are separated  species (L. african and L cyclotis respectivel). Elephant are scattered throughout sub-Sharan Africa, South Asi, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the onnly surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other now extinct, members of the order inlude deinotheres, gomphothers, mommoths and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extnt terrestial animals and can reach a height of 4m (13 ft) and weight 7 000 kg (15 000 lb).</p>
                    <p>All elephants have serveral distinctive features, the most notible of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particulary brething, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisor grow into tusks, which can be serve as weapons and as a tools for moving object and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps helps to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have large ears and concave backs while Asiaan elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are herbivous and can be found in defferent habitats including savvanah, forest, dersets and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
