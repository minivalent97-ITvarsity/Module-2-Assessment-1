                    <p>The giraffe is an African artiodactyl mammal the tallest living terestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subsecies, However, te existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described, based upon reseach into the mitochodrial and nuclear DNA,as wel as morphological measurements of Giraffe. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils.The giraffe's chif distinguishing characterisic are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distincive coat patterns.It is classified under the family Giraffidea, along with ts closest extant relative, the okapi. its scattered range extends from chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and Niger in th west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Thier food source is leaves, fruit and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at height most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes may be preyedon by loin, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related emales and their offsprings, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregation. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking" which are combat bouts where the neck is used as weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
