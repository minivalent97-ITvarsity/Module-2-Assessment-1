                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <P>The gemsbok is a large antelope in the grnus Oryx. it is native to the arid regions of Southen Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subpecies.Gemesbok are light brownish-grey to tan in colour, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks'with a black patch on the front of both the front legs and both genders have long, straigth horns. Comparably, the  are  African oryx lacks a dark parth at the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare colour morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.</P>
                    <p>Gemsbok are the largest species i the genus oryx. They stand about 1.2m (3.9 ft) at the shoulder. The body length can vary from 190 to 240cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90cm (18 to 35 in). Male gemsbok can weigh betweenn 180 and 240kg (400 and 530lb).</p>

                    <p>You will found them in a regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Dersert.</p>
