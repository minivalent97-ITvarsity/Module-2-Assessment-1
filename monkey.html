                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups of mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder Smiiformers. The term is applied descriptively to group of primates, such as families of New World monkes and old workd monkeys. Many monkeys species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active duriing day. Monkeys are geerally considered to be intelligrnt, especially the old world monkeys of catarrhini. Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago. New world monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago. Old world monkeys and hominiodea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago. Extint basal simians such as aegyptopithecus or parapitheus [35-32 million years ago], eosimiidea and sometimes even the catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatoligists.</p>
                    <p>Lemurs, lorises and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhini primates, like monkeys tarsiesrs are hapolorhine primates; however thry are also not monkeys.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>Monkeys tend to inhabits the tropical rainforest of Africa, centraal Amrica, South America and Asia.</p>
